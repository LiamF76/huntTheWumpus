I used chatgpt for a few things, here were my prompts:

1. Give me a basic python template fire with a main function that prints hello world
    Used the entire thing, my base starter file
2. Take this cave map and double its size to 20 (size of a wumpus cave grid), I gave it a few lines of the graph to add to cause I didn't want to copy it all
    Used the entire graph
3. How would I generate multiple random numbers from a range in python?
    It recommended I use the .sample thing, so I used that for my generating of the pit locations.
