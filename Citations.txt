I used chatgpt for a few things, here were my prompts:

1. Give me a basic python template fire with a main function that prints hello world
    Used the entire thing, my base starter file
2. Take this cave map and double its size to 20 (size of a wumpus cave grid), I gave it a few lines of the graph to add to cause I didn't want to copy it all
    Used the entire graph
3. How would I generate multiple random numbers from a range in python?
    It recommended I use the .sample thing, so I used that for my generating of the pit locations.
4. I copy-pasted my whole code and just asked: make me a dockerfile for this project so a user can run it themselves.
    name: Lint and Build Docker

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - '**.py'
      - Dockerfile
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**.py'
      - Dockerfile

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: Install flake8
        run: |
          pip install flake8
      - name: Run flake8
        run: flake8 .

  docker-build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: lint

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t wumpus-game .

      - name: Run Docker image to test it
        run: |
          docker run -i wumpus-game <<EOF
          1
          2
          EOF

    Above was added to my yml lint file, and below was my dockerfile

    # Use the official Python image from DockerHub
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy all files into the container
COPY . /app

# Set the default command to run your game
CMD ["python", "game.py"]


Done and done!
